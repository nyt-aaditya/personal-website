          <h3>3 Idiots</h3>
          <p>
            "3 Idiots" is a 2009 Indian comedy-drama film directed by Rajkumar
            Hirani. The story follows three engineering students—Rancho, Farhan,
            and Raju—at a prestigious college in India. Through their journey,
            the film explores the pressure of the education system, the

            With humor, emotion, and a powerful message, "3 Idiots" encourages
            thinking differently and living life on your own terms. The film
            stars Aamir Khan, R. Madhavan, and Sharman Joshi, and is widely
